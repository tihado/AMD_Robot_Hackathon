# 🍽️ EatAble

### _From a meal... to a life of independence._

---

## 🌟 Overview

**EatAble** is a voice-controlled robotic assistant designed to empower people with **upper limb disabilities** to eat independently — restoring **dignity**, **freedom**, and **equality** through accessible AI and robotics.

At its core, EatAble allows a person to simply **say what they want to eat**, and the robot will find that item on the table and **gently feed them**. This project started with feeding, but the long-term vision is broader: **Creating a world where disability does not limit autonomy.**

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Millions of people live with physical disabilities that make daily tasks — even eating — a challenge. For many, this means:

- Relying on others for basic needs
- Losing a sense of independence
- Feeling isolated in everyday life

**EatAble** is designed to help **restore independence and dignity** using affordable, real-time technology that can work at home, in hospitals, or in care centers.

> “We don’t just build robots.  
> We build freedom — one meal at a time.”

## 🧪 How It Works

1. 👤 **User says**:  
   _"I want to eat carrots."_

2. 🎙️ **Voice command** is interpreted by offline speech recognition.

3. 🖼️ **Camera feed** is analyzed in real time to identify location of the requested food.

4. 🤖 **Robotic arm** picks up the item and delivers it gently to the user's mouth.

5. ♻️ System resets, ready for the next bite.
